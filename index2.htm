These efforts include offering universities funding for student scholarships, funding for building capacity in cybersecurity education, as well as sponsoring cybersecurity competitions, games, and outreach programs. This paper examines the effectiveness of cybersecurity competitions in educating students. Our study shows that though competitions do pique students' interest, the effectiveness of this approach in producing more high quality professionals can be limited. One reason is that the knowledge barrier to compete in these competitions is high. To be successful, students have to be proficient in operating systems, application services, software engineering, system administration and networking. Many Computer Science and Information Technology students do not feel qualified, and consequently this reduces participation from a wider student audience. Our approach takes aims at lowering this barrier to entry. We employ a hands-on learning methodology where students attend lectures on background knowledge on weekdays and practice what they learn in weekend workshops. A virtual networking environment is provided for students to practice network defense in the workshops and on their own time.},

However, advances in surveying craters present in data gathered by planetary probes have not kept up with advances in data collection. One challenge of auto-detecting craters in images is to identify an image's features that discriminate it between craters and other surface objects. The problem of optimal feature selection is known to be {NP-hard} and the search is computationally intractable. In this paper we propose a wrapper based randomized feature selection method to efficiently select relevant features for crater detection. We design and implement a dynamic programming algorithm to search for a relevant feature subset by removing irrelevant features and minimizing a cost objective function simultaneously. In order to only remove irrelevant features we use Bernoulli Trials to calculate the probability of such a case using the cost function. Our proposed algorithms are empirically evaluated on a large high-resolution Martian image exhibiting a heavily cratered Martian terrain characterized by heterogeneous surface morphology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a higher accuracy than other existing randomized
approaches to a large extent with less runtime.},

In this study, students established essential questions which reflected their interests in information security, formulated challenges on how to safeguard confidential information from cyber attacks and then came up with solutions to secure their information and network. For guiding activities, students participated in two cybersecurity competitions against their peers from other local universities. In these simulated real-life competitions, students were forced to work together, think on their own two feet and apply their knowledge to defend against cyber attacks. Assessments performed after the study showed improvement in students' computer and security skills, interest in learning security and ability to teach others.},

		<p>I made a LaTeX homework template so that students at UMB

			<br>The
			template explains how to draw Automatons such as DFAs, NFAs, and
			PDAs. It's much easier to copy and paste a DFA then to redraw
			one. It also includes examples for drawing trees.
			These examples use the Tikz library so all code is contained
			inside the .tex file.

	A team from UMB consisting of me, Veronica Carrillo Marquez, 
	Fabio Elia, and Henry Z Lo  won 2nd place.  We crafted our own 
	exploit during the competition that was used to erase all by one 
	opposing teams hard drive.  We were able to obtain a shell by 
	creating a specially crafted HTTP cookie that had access to a 
	poorly filtered eval() call. We were able to avoid specific function 
	names in order to launch a remote interactive shell using PHP pipes.  
	This method used an RPC call in wordpress which didn't leave any traces 
	in the log files. Our exploit and payload needed to be base64 encoded 
	which made it very hard to reuse by other teams if they had someone 
	captured the attack in action. We scripted the creation of payloads 
	which allowed us to change ports and ip addresses to counter other
	 teams defensive measures.  
	<br>
	Once we gained a shell on the target machines we were able to use a
	 recently discovered LPE to obtain root permissions.  The attack was
	  sloppy and caused a kernel oops when we disconnected.  Next year we
	   will be more prepared for post-exploitation.

Sunday, June 05, 2011 | 10:00am to 4pm<br/>
<br/>
Meet researchers who work closely with NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to change how we look at the Universe.
<br/><br/>
Modern satellites orbiting the Moon and Mars are sending us
astonishingly detailed images of craters, canyons, gullies, and lava flows. What can these surface features tell us about the past and present, and what do they mean for future exploration by robots and humans? If we found evidence of life on Mars, what would it look like?
<br/><br/>
During this weekend event, drive model Mars rovers on real and virtual terrain, and try activities and games for adults and kids. Enjoy short presentations about planetary exploration by guest scientists from the University of Massachusetts, Boston, Ohio State University, and the Lunar and Planetary Institute.
