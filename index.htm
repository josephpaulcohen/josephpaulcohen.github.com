	abstract = {There has been a heightened interest among {U.S.} government agencies to fund cybersecurity workforce development. These efforts include offering universities funding for student scholarships, funding for building capacity in cybersecurity education, as well as sponsoring cybersecurity competitions, games, and outreach programs. This paper examines the effectiveness of cybersecurity competitions in educating students. Our study shows that though competitions do pique students' interest, the effectiveness of this approach in producing more high quality professionals can be limited. One reason is that the knowledge barrier to compete in these competitions is high. To be successful, students have to be proficient in operating systems, application services, software engineering, system administration and networking. Many Computer Science and Information Technology students do not feel qualified, and consequently this reduces participation from a wider student audience. Our approach takes aims at lowering this barrier to entry. We employ a hands-on learning methodology where students attend lectures on background knowledge on weekdays and practice what they learn in weekend workshops. A virtual networking environment is provided for students to practice network defense in the workshops and on their own time.},

However, advances in surveying craters present in data gathered by planetary probes have not kept up with advances in data collection. One challenge of auto-detecting craters in images is to identify an image's features that discriminate it between craters and other surface objects. The problem of optimal feature selection is known to be {NP-hard} and the search is computationally intractable. In this paper we propose a wrapper based randomized feature selection method to efficiently select relevant features for crater detection. We design and implement a dynamic programming algorithm to search for a relevant feature subset by removing irrelevant features and minimizing a cost objective function simultaneously. In order to only remove irrelevant features we use Bernoulli Trials to calculate the probability of such a case using the cost function. Our proposed algorithms are empirically evaluated on a large high-resolution Martian image exhibiting a heavily cratered Martian terrain characterized by heterogeneous surface morphology. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a higher accuracy than other existing randomized
approaches to a large extent with less runtime.},

The overall goal is to improve student learning via a multidisciplinary approach which encourages students to collaborate with their peers, ask questions, develop a deeper understanding of the subject and take actions in solving real-world challenges. In this study, students established essential questions which reflected their interests in information security, formulated challenges on how to safeguard confidential information from cyber attacks and then came up with solutions to secure their information and network. For guiding activities, students participated in two cybersecurity competitions against their peers from other local universities. In these simulated real-life competitions, students were forced to work together, think on their own two feet and apply their knowledge to defend against cyber attacks. Assessments performed after the study showed improvement in students' computer and security skills, interest in learning security and ability to teach others.},

		<h1>2011 MIT Lincoln Laboratory / CSAIL Capture the Flag Competition</h1>
		A team from UMB consisting of me, Veronica Carrillo Marquez, 
		Fabio Elia, and Henry Z Lo  won 2nd place.  We crafted our own 
		exploit during the competition that was used to erase all by one 
		opposing teams hard drive.  We were able to obtain a shell by 
		creating a specially crafted HTTP cookie that had access to a 
		poorly filtered eval() call. We were able to avoid specific function 
		names in order to launch a remote interactive shell using PHP pipes.  
		This method used an RPC call in wordpress which didn't leave any traces 
		in the log files. Our exploit and payload needed to be base64 encoded 
		which made it very hard to reuse by other teams if they had someone 
		captured the attack in action. We scripted the creation of payloads 
		which allowed us to change ports and ip addresses to counter other
		 teams defensive measures.  
		<br>
		Once we gained a shell on the target machines we were able to use a
		 recently discovered LPE to obtain root permissions.  The attack was
		  sloppy and caused a kernel oops when we disconnected.  Next year we
		   will be more prepared for post-exploitation.

Sunday, June 05, 2011 | 10:00am to 4pm<br/>
<br/>
Meet researchers who work closely with NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to change how we look at the Universe.
<br/><br/>
Modern satellites orbiting the Moon and Mars are sending us
astonishingly detailed images of craters, canyons, gullies, and lava flows. What can these surface features tell us about the past and present, and what do they mean for future exploration by robots and humans? If we found evidence of life on Mars, what would it look like?
<br/><br/>
During this weekend event, drive model Mars rovers on real and virtual terrain, and try activities and games for adults and kids. Enjoy short presentations about planetary exploration by guest scientists from the University of Massachusetts, Boston, Ohio State University, and the Lunar and Planetary Institute.

		To provide a place where students can learn and discuss about topics in security.
		To share our experiences in cyber-defense competitions.

		<p>This is a general version of the Google Gravity code written by Mr. Doob as a Chrome Experiment. </p>
		<p>Just Include this file somewhere inside the body or head tag </p>
		<p><tt>&lt;script src="http://gravityscript.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gravityscript.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</tt> </p>
		<p>If you include this script or eval this javascript after the body tag has loaded it will do it's awesome thing. </p>
